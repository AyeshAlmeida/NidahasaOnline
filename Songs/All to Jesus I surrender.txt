All to Jesus I surrender   D   4/4

[D]All to Jesus [A]I surrender,
[Bm]All to [G]Him I [A]freely [D]give;
[D]I will ever [A]love and trust Him,
[Bm]In His [G]presence [A]daily [D]live.

CHORUS:
[D]I surrender [Em]all,
[A]I surrender [D]all.
[D]All to [D7]Thee, my [G]blessed Savior,
[A]I surrender [D]all.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow,
Worldly pleasures all forsaken;
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred flame.
Oh, the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to His name!
