I will sing Am 4/4

Am                F
Lord You seem so far away
   C                G
A million miles or more
          Dm
It feels today.
Am                F
Though I haven?t lost my faith
   C                  G
I must confess right now
           C               G
That it?s hard for me to pray.

Refrain:
       Am                 F
But I don?t know what to say
       C                    G
And I don?t know where to start
    Am               F
But as You give the grace
      G                Em7
With all that?s in my heart

Chorus:
        C             F
I will sing, I will praise
     Am             G
Even in my darkest hour
             F              G
Through the sorrow and the pain
        C             F
I will sing, I will praise
         Am             G
Lift my hands to honor You
   F                   G
Because Your word is true
        C
I will sing!

Am                  F
Lord it?s hard for me to see
C                     G
All the thoughts and plans
             Dm
You have for me.
    Am             F
But I will put my trust in You
C                  G
Knowing that You died
    C       G
To set me free.
Refrain
Chorus 2x
        F            C
I will sing, I will sing!
