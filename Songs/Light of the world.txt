Light of the world   E   4/4

[E]Light of the [B]world You stepped [F#m]down into darkness
[E]Opened my [B]eyes let me [A]see
[E]Beauty that [B]made this [F#m]heart adore You
[E]Hope of a [B]life spent with [A]You

Here I am to [E]worship Here I am to [B]bow down
Here I am to [E]say that You're my [A]God
You're altogether [E]lovely Altogether [B]worthy
Altogether [E]wonderful to [A]me

King of all days Oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor


I'll [B]never kn[E]ow how [A]much it cost
To [B]see my [E]sin up[A]on that cross
