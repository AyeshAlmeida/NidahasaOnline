In Christ alone - F - 3/4

Intro: F Bb Dm C

In [Bb]Christ a[F]lone my [Bb]hope is [C]found
[F/A]He is my [Bb]light, my [C]strength, my [F]song
This [Bb]corner[F]stone, this [Bb]solid [C]ground
[F/A]Firm through the [Bb]fiercest [C]drought and [F]storm
What [F/A]heights of [Bb]love, what [F]depths of [C]peace
When [F/A]fears are [Bb]stilled, when [F]strivings [C]cease
My [Bb]comfor[F]ter, my [Bb]all-in-[C]all
[F/A]Here in the [Bb]love of [C]Christ I [F]stand

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain:
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
For I am His and He is mine -
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death,
This is the power of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath.
Jesus commands my destiny.
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home,
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.
