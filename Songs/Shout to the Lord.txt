Shout to the Lord   C   4/4

[C] My Jesus, [G] My Saviour,
[Am]Lord there is [G]none like [F]you,
All of my [C]days, [F]I want to [C]praise
The [Am]wonders of Your [Bb]mighty [G]love.

[C] My comfort, [G] my shelter,
[Am]Tower of [G]refuge and [F]strength
Let every [C]breath, [F]all that I [C]am
[Am]Never cease to [Bb]worship [Gsus4]You.

Chorus:
[C]Shout to the [Am]Lord, all the [F]earth let us [G]sing,
[C]Power and [Am]majesty, [F]praise to the [G]King!
[C]Mountains bow [Am]down and the [F]seas will roar,
At the [G]sound of your [G7]name!
[C]I sing for [Am]joy at the [F]work of your [G]hands,
Fo[C]rever I'll [Am]love you, for[F]ever I'll [G]stand
[C]Nothing com[Am]pares to the [F]promise I [G]have in [C]You.
