Lord, I offer my life to You F 4/4

[F]All that I am, [Bb]all that I have
 [C]I lay them down before  [Gm]You, oh [F]Lord
[Dm]All my regrets, [Bb]all my acclaims
The [Gm]joy and the pa[F]in, I'm [Bb]making them Yo[C]urs

[F]Lord, I offer my li[Dm]fe to You
Everything [Gm]I've been thro[F]ugh, [Bb]use it for Your [C]glory
[F]Lord I offer my day[Dm]s to You
Lifting my [Gm]praise to You[F]  [Bb]as a pleasing [C]sacri[Dm]fice
[Gm]Lord I offer [C]You my [F]life [C7]

Things in the past, things yet unseen
Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true
All of my heart, all of my praise
My heart and my hands are lifted to You

What can we give that You have not given?
And what do we have that is not already Yours?
All we possess are these lives we're living
That's what we give to You, Lord
