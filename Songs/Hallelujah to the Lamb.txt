Hallelujah to the Lamb   A   4/4

[A]Lord I stand in the midst of a [D/A]multitude
Of [A]those from every[E] tribe and [F#m
]tongue
[A/E]We are Your [D]people redeemed by Your [Bm7]blood
Rescued from [D/E]death by Your [E]love  [D/E]
There are no [A]words good enough to [D/A]thank You
There are no [A]words to ex-[E]press my praise  [F#m]
[A/E]But I will [D]lift up my voice And [A]sing from my heart
With [Bm7]all of my strength [D/E]  [E]  [D/E]  [E]

Halle-[A]lujah halle-[F#m]lujah halle-l[D]ujah to the [E]Lamb
Halle-[A]lujah halle-[F#m]lujah
By the [D]blood of Christ we [E]stand
Every [A]tongue      every [F#m]tribe
Every [D]people every [E]land
Giving [A]glory giving [F#m]honor
Giving [D]praise unto the [Esus]Lamb
of [A]God [F#m]  [D]  [E]
