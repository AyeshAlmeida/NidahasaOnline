[D]As the [A]deer panteth [Bm]for the
[Em]waters
So my [G]soul longeth [A]after [D]thee [A7]
[D]You a[A]lone are my [Bm]heartâ€™s
de[Em]sire
And I [G]long to [Asus]worship [D]thee

[Bm]You alone are my [G]strength my
[F#m]shield
To [G]You alone may my [Em]spirit
[F#]yield [F#7]
[D]You a[A]lone are my [Bm]hearts de[Em]sire
And I [G]long to [Asus]worship [D]thee

[D]I want [A]you more than [Bm]gold or [Em]silver,
Only [G]You can [A]satis[D]fy [A7]
[D]You a[A]lone are the [Bm]real joy [Em]giver
And the [G]apple [Asus]of my [D]eye.

[D]You're my [A]friend and you [Bm]are my Em[]brother,
Even [G]though you [A]are a [D]King [A7]
[D]I love [A]You more than [Bm]any [Em]other
So much [G]more than [Asus]any[D]thing.
