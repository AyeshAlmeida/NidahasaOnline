How great is our God   C   4/4

The sp[C]lendor of the King, [Am]clothed in majesty. Let all the
earth [F]rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
He [C]wraps Himself in light, and [Am]darkness tries to hide, and trembles at
his [F2]voice,
trembles at his voice.

How [C]great is our God, sing with me, how [Am]great is our God.
And all will see, how [F]great, how gre[G]at is our [C]God.

[C]Age to age He stands, and [Am]time is in His hands, beginning and the
[F]end, beginning and the end.
The [C]Godhead, three in one: [Am]Father, Spirit, Son, the Lion and the
 [F]Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

[C]Name above all names. [Am]worthy of all praise.
My [F]heart will sing how [G]great is our [C]God.
