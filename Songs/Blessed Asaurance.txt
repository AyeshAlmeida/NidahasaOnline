Blessed Assurance C 3/4


[C]Blessed assurance, [F]Jesus is [C]mine!
O what a [Am7]fore[G]taste of [D]glory [G]divine!
Heir of sal[C]vation, [F]purchase of [C]God,
Born of his [Dm]Spirit, [G]washed in his [C]blood.

[Chorus]
This is my [C]story, [F]this is my [C]song,
Praising my [F]Savior [D] all the day [G]long [G7]
This is my [C]story, [F]this is my [C]song [Am]
Praising my [Dm]Savior [G]
all the day [C]long

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending bring from above,
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest;
I in my Savior am happy and blessed,
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with his goodness, lost in his love.
