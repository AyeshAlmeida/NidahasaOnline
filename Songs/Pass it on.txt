Pass it on D 4/4

It [D]only takes a [F#m]spark to [G]set a fire [A]glowing
And [D]soon all those a[F#m]round can [G]warm up in its [A]glowing
That's [G]how it is with [D]God's love
[Em] Once [A]you've ex[F#m]perienced [Bm]it
you sp[Em7]read His [D]love to [Em7]every[D]one,
You [G]want to [A]pass it [D]on

What a wondrous time is spring, when all the trees are budding
The birds begin to sing, the flowers start their blooming
That's how it is with God's love
Once you've experienced it,
You want to sing It's fresh like spring
You want to pass it on

I wish for you my friend, this happiness that I've found
You can depend on Him, it matters not where you're bound
I'll shout it from the mountain top
I want the world to know,
The Lord of love has come to me,
I want to pass it on
