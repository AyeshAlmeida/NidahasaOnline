You are my all in all   G   4/4

[G] You are my [D]strength when I am [Em]weak
You are the [Bm]treasure that I [C]seek
You are my [G]all in [Em]all [D]
[G]  Seeking You [D]as a precious [Em]jewel
Lord, to give [Bm]up I'd be a [C]fool
You are my [G]all [D]in [G]all

[G]Je[D]sus, [Em]Lamb of [Bm]God, [C]worthy [G]is Your [Em]name[D]
[G]Je[D]sus, [Em]Lamb of [Bm]God, [C]worthy [G]is Your [D]name[G]


Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
Rising again I bless Your name
You are my all in all
When I fall down You pick me up
When I am dry You fill my cup
You are my all in all
