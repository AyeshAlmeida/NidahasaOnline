Lord, I come to You G  4/4

[G] Lord, I [D]come to [Em]You,     let my heart be [Bm]changed,
re[Em]newed,
[D]Flowing from the [C]grace, That I [D]found in [Em]You [D]
[G] Lord, I've [D]come to [Em]know, The weaknesses I [Bm]see in [Em]me,
[D]Will be stripped a[C]way, [D] By the power of Your [G]love

[C]Hol[Em]d  me [D]close, Let Your love sur[C]round [G]me [D] [Em] [D]
[C]Brin[Em]g me [D]near, Draw me to Your [G]side [Am7] [G]
And [C]as[Em] I [D]wait, I'll rise up like the [C]ea[G]gle
And I will [D/F#]soar with [Em]You, Your Spirit [D]leads me [C]on
In the [D]power of Your [G]Love

Lord unveil my eyes, Let me see You face to face
The knowledge of Your love, As You live in me
Lord renew my mind,
As Your will unfolds in my life
In living every day, In the power of Your Love
